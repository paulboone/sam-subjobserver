# Only use max_seconds_per_job if you WANT to kill the job after a specified time. If this is
# unspecified, the default of 100 days or 8640000 seconds will be used. In practice, this means
# your job will run until your worker runs out of walltime.
# max_seconds_per_job: 8640000

# only use min_seconds_per_job if, when there is less than min_seconds_per_job of walltime left,
# you want your workers to exit instead of grab the next job from the queue.
# min_seconds_per_job: 7200
